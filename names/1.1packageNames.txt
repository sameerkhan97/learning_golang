*When a package is imported, the package name becomes an accessor for the contents

*By convention, packages are given lower case, single-word names; there should be no need for underscores or mixedCaps

*the importing package can choose a different name to use locally. 

*the package name is the base name of its source directory; the package in src/encoding/base64 is imported as "encoding/base64" 
 but has name base64, not encoding_base64 and not encodingBase64.

*The importer of a package will use the name to refer to its contents, so exported names in the package can use that fact to avoid stutter. 
 (Don't use the import . notation, which can simplify tests that must run outside the package they are testing, but should otherwise be avoided.) For instance, 
 the buffered reader type in the bufio package is called Reader, not BufReader, because users see it as bufio.Reader, which is a clear, concise name. Moreover, 
 because imported entities are always addressed with their package name, bufio.Reader does not conflict with io.Reader.
