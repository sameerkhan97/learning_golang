* By convention, one-method interfaces are named by the method name plus an -er suffix or similar modification 
  to construct an agent noun: Reader, Writer, Formatter, CloseNotifier etc.

* There are a number of such names and it's productive to honor them and the function names they capture. 
  Read, Write, Close, Flush, String and so on have canonical signatures and meanings

* To avoid confusion, don't give your method one of those names unless it has the same signature and meaning.

* Conversely, if your type implements a method with the same meaning as a method on a well-known type,
  give it the same name and signature; call your string-converter method String not ToString.
