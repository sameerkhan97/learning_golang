/* * An unused import like fmt or io in the previous example should eventually be used or removed: 
  blank assignments identify code as a work in progress. 

* But sometimes it is useful to import a package only for its side effects, without any explicit use.

* For example, during its init function, the net/http/pprof package registers HTTP handlers that provide debugging information. 
  It has an exported API, but most clients need only the handler registration and access the data through a web page
 
* To import the package only for its side effects, rename the package to the blank identifier:
            import _ "net/http/pprof"

* This form of import makes clear that the package is being imported for its side effects, because there is no other possible use 
  of the package: in this file, it doesn't have a name. (If it did, and we didn't use that name, the compiler would reject the program.)
